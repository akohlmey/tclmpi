Compilation:
The TclMPI package currently consist of a single C source file which
needs to be compiled for dynamic linkage and a Tcl pkgIndex.tcl file
that hooks it into the Tcl environment. You need a working Tcl and MPI
development environment (C-only). Since compilataion will create a
dynamical shared object (DSO), both Tcl and MPI have to be compiled
and as shared libraries. This is the default for Tcl and OpenMPI on
Linux, but your mileage may vary.

To compile the package adjust the settings in the Makefile according to
your platform, MPI and Tcl installation. Typical settings for Linux and
MacOSX systems are included as comments in the provided makefile. Then
type "make" to compile the tclmpi.so file. With "make check" you can run
the integrated unittests to see if everything is working as expected.

Installation:
To install you can create a directory, e.g. /usr/local/libexec/tclmpi,
and copy the files tclmpi.so and pkgIndex.tcl into it. If you then use
the command 'set auto_path [concat /usr/local/libexec/tclmpi $auto_path]'
in your .tclshrc or .vmdrc, you can load the tclmpi wrappers on demand
simply by using the command 'package require tclmpi'.
