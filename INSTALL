Compilation:
The TclMPI package currently consist   of  a C source file,   _tclmpi.c,
which needs  to  be compiled for  dynamic  linkage, and two  Tcl  script
files,   tclmpi.tcl  and   pkgIndex.tcl  that hook   it  into  the   Tcl
environment.  You need a   working Tcl and MPI   development environment
(C-only). Since compilation will create a dynamical shared object (DSO),
both  Tcl and MPI  have to be compiled as  shared libraries. This is the
default for  Tcl and OpenMPI  on Linux, but  your  mileage may  vary. To
update the documentation you will also need doxygen 1.8 or later and its
prerequistes ((pdf)latex, dvi2ps, ghostscript, graphviz) installed.

To compile the package adjust the  settings in the Makefile according to
your platform, MPI and Tcl installation.  Typical settings for Linux and
MacOSX systems are included as  comments in the provided makefile.  Then
type "make" to compile  the _tclmpi.so file.  With "make check"  you can
run  the  integrated  unit  tests to  see  if  everything  is working as
expected.  With "make  doc" the  documentation can be  updated and "make
all" will run all three steps together.

Installation:
To install you  can create a directory, e.g.  /usr/local/libexec/tclmpi,
and copy the  files _tclmpi.so, tclmpi.tcl  and pkgIndex.tcl into it. If
you  then     use     the     command    'set    auto_path       [concat
/usr/local/libexec/tclmpi $auto_path]' in  your .tclshrc  or .vmdrc, you
can load the   tclmpi wrappers on  demand simply  by  using  the command
'package require tclmpi'.
