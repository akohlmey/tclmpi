This package contains software that wraps an MPI library for Tcl and
allows MPI calls to be used from Tcl scripts. The wrapper is a shared 
object that can be loaded into a running Tcl interpreter and will provide
additional Tcl commands that allow to run Tcl scripts in parallel via
"mpirun" or "mpiexec" similar to C, C++ or Fortran programs.
