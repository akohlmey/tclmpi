This package contains software that wraps an MPI library for Tcl and
allows MPI calls to be used from Tcl scripts. The wrapper is a shared 
object that can be loaded into a running Tcl interpreter and will provide
additional Tcl commands that allow to run Tcl scripts in parallel via
"mpirun" or "mpiexec" similar to C, C++ or Fortran programs.

Version History---------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.1
  Initial test version, unreleased
Version 0.2
  First public version. Supported operations: init, finalize, comm_rank,
comm_size, comm_split, barrier, bcast, allreduce, send, recv, and probe.
Version 0.3
  Added operation: abort. Added unit tests. Converted MPI errors into Tcl 
errors (so they can be handled with catch), argument testing code refactoring.
Version 0.4
  Fixed several bugs, more unit tests, better checking of arguments and
error reports for it. Update/bugfix to pi.tcl example.
Version 0.5
  Fixed a few bugs and significantly cleaned up the argument
handling. Added some non-blocking operations: isend, irecv, iprobe and
wait. Added parallel unit tests and wrote a simple test harness for
it. This version will be considered feature complete unless specific
needs arise or requests are being made. For the foreseeable time, only
bugfixes, documentation updates, and text & example programs will be
added.
