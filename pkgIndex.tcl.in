# Tcl package index file, version 1.1
# This file is supposed to be sourced either when an 
# application starts up or by a "package unknown" script.
# It invokes the "package ifneeded" command to set up
# package-related information so that packages will be
# loaded automatically in response to "package require"
# commands.  When this script is sourced, the variable $dir
# must contain the full path name of this file's directory.

# as of Tcl 8.6 we need to use "load -global" in order to support
# OpenMPI or any other MPI library, that dynamically loads its
# components at runtime. Since older Tcl versions do not know this
# load flag, we have to use this hack for backward compatibility.
