This subdirectory contains unit tests for TclMPI.
They are executed through "make check" from the 
top level directory. It currently contains the 
following files.

harness.tcl:
the actual test harness, i.e. a bunch of functions and
stuff that will allow to run command (serial and paralle),
capture its output/return value and (most) errors and 
compare them to a reference.

test_01.tcl:
Simple tests that can be run in serial. This is mostly
testing validity of arguments and internal handling of data

test_02.tcl:
Tests that need to be run with two MPI processes. This
is mostly testing of proper sending of data. It cannot
test for situations where deadlocks, data corruption 
or aborts/segfaults would happen.
